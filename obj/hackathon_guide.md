# DeepSearch Observability Hackathon Guide

## Overview

This 3-hour hackathon challenges teams to implement observability for the DeepSearch system using OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). Each team will include members with both LLM expertise and observability knowledge working together.

## Team Structure

Teams will be formed by mixing members with complementary expertise:
- **LLM Knowledge**: Understanding of large language models, DeepSearch architecture, and semantic search
- **Observability Skills**: Experience with monitoring, metrics, tracing, and visualization

This mixed-team approach encourages knowledge sharing and ensures each team has the complete skill set needed to succeed.

## Hackathon Structure

### Time Allocation
- **15 minutes**: Introduction and setup
- **45 minutes**: Basic implementation (80-100 points possible)
- **60 minutes**: Intermediate implementation (120-160 points possible)
- **45 minutes**: Advanced implementation (60-90 points possible)
- **15 minutes**: Presentations and wrap-up

### Progression System

The hackathon employs a **progressive point system**:
1. Teams must complete most basic tasks before advancing to intermediate tasks
2. Teams must complete most intermediate tasks before attempting advanced tasks
3. Points are awarded upon verification of working implementations

This encourages building a solid foundation rather than rushing to complex features.

## Task Categories

### Basic Tasks (10 points each)
These tasks establish the required foundation:
- Core setup of OpenTelemetry infrastructure
- Basic tracing of main workflow components
- Simple metrics collection for key operations
- Error handling instrumentation

### Intermediate Tasks (20 points each)
Building on the foundation:
- Enhanced tracing with detailed spans for each phase
- Meaningful metrics for performance and quality
- Dashboard visualizations of the research process
- Contextual attributes for deeper analysis

### Advanced Tasks (30 points each)
Deep insights into system behavior:
- Advanced analysis of research patterns
- Custom telemetry processing for LLM operations
- Integration features for comprehensive monitoring
- Performance anomaly detection

## Evaluation Criteria

Teams will be evaluated on:

1. **Functionality** (40%)
   - Working OpenTelemetry implementation
   - Key components properly instrumented
   - Data correctly collected and exported

2. **Insightfulness** (30%)
   - Meaningful metrics and traces that reveal system behavior
   - Clear visualization of the research process
   - Ability to explain what the data shows

3. **Technical Implementation** (20%)
   - Code quality and organization
   - Appropriate use of OpenTelemetry concepts
   - Integration between components

4. **Completeness** (10%)
   - Breadth of implementation across the system
   - Coverage of different telemetry types (traces, metrics, logs)

## Getting Started

1. Review the observability_tasks.md document for the detailed task list
2. Start with the Core Setup tasks (required)
3. Select appropriate tasks from each category based on your team's expertise
4. Follow the progression system to build incrementally

Remember to focus on delivering working implementations rather than attempting too many features. Quality over quantity!
