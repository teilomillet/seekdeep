# DeepSearch Observability Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the tasks for implementing OpenTelemetry (OTLP) observability in the DeepSearch system. Tasks are organized in three tiers of increasing complexity.

> **Important**: Teams must complete most basic tasks before progressing to intermediate tasks, and most intermediate tasks before advancing to advanced tasks. This ensures a working foundation before attempting complex features.

## Basic Tasks (10 points each)
*These tasks establish the foundation required for all observability. Focus on completing these first.*

### Core Setup (Required)
- [ ] Install OpenTelemetry Python SDK and dependencies
- [ ] Configure basic OTLP exporter and collector
- [ ] Set up a local visualization tool (Jaeger or Grafana)

### Basic Tracing (At least 3 required)
- [ ] Add trace context to `deep_search` main entry point
- [ ] Create spans for main LLM operations
- [ ] Implement basic vector search tracing
- [ ] Add error handling instrumentation 
- [ ] Track basic research iteration loops

### Basic Metrics (At least 2 required)
- [ ] Track total execution time
- [ ] Count number of search iterations
- [ ] Measure token usage for LLM calls
- [ ] Monitor basic resource utilization

## Intermediate Tasks (20 points each)
*Only attempt after completing at least 8 basic tasks. These tasks build on the foundation.*

### Enhanced Tracing (Choose 2-3)
- [ ] Create spans for each research phase:
  - Question decomposition
  - Query expansion
  - Vector search
  - Answer generation
  - Answer evaluation
- [ ] Add contextual attributes to spans (token counts, query complexity)
- [ ] Track the decomposition of questions
- [ ] Monitor "beast mode" activation

### Meaningful Metrics (Choose 2-3)
- [ ] Implement histograms for LLM and search latency
- [ ] Track vector search quality metrics
- [ ] Measure answer quality metrics
- [ ] Monitor resource utilization (memory, CPU)
- [ ] Count hallucination detection events

### Visualization (Required)
- [ ] Create dashboard showing basic research flow
- [ ] Visualize performance metrics

## Advanced Tasks (30 points each)
*Only attempt after completing at least 6 intermediate tasks. These provide deep insights.*

### Deep Analysis (Choose 1-2)
- [ ] Implement semantic drift tracking
- [ ] Create question decomposition visualizations
- [ ] Track answer quality improvement across iterations
- [ ] Design comprehensive resource utilization monitoring

### Integration Features (Choose 1-2)
- [ ] Implement trace compression for large text payloads
- [ ] Create custom OTLP processor for LLM telemetry
- [ ] Design anomaly detection for unusual behavior patterns
- [ ] Create cost analysis dashboard (tokens/computation)
