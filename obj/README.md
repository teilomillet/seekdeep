# DeepSearch Observability Hackathon

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the DeepSearch Observability Hackathon, a 3-hour exercise where teams implement OpenTelemetry (OTLP) instrumentation for a DeepSearch system. Each team will include members with both LLM expertise and observability knowledge.

## Documents

- **[observability_tasks.md](observability_tasks.md)**: Simplified task list with clear progression path and priorities
- **[implementation_targets.md](implementation_targets.md)**: Specific functions and components to instrument in the codebase
- **[hackathon_guide.md](hackathon_guide.md)**: Hackathon structure, progression system, and evaluation criteria

## Key Features of This Hackathon

- **Mixed Expertise Teams**: Each team combines LLM and observability knowledge
- **Progressive Implementation**: Teams must build foundations before attempting advanced features
- **Structured Task Categories**: Clear organization of tasks by complexity and value
- **Practical Time Management**: Realistic milestones for a 3-hour exercise

## Hackathon Goal

The primary goal is to implement observability that provides meaningful insights into the DeepSearch system's behavior, performance, and effectiveness. Teams should focus on creating a working foundation before progressing to more complex features.

## Getting Started

Participants should:

1. Review all documentation in this directory
2. Form mixed teams with complementary expertise
3. Follow the progression system (basic → intermediate → advanced)
4. Prioritize working implementations over quantity of features

## Scoring System

Points are awarded based on task completion:
- Basic tasks: 10 points each (must complete most before advancing)
- Intermediate tasks: 20 points each (must complete most before advancing)
- Advanced tasks: 30 points each (only attempt after solid foundation)

## Implementation Timeline

- **First Hour**: Complete setup and basic instrumentation
- **Second Hour**: Implement intermediate features and initial dashboard
- **Final Hour**: Add advanced features and prepare presentation
