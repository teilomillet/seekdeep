# DeepSearch Observability Challenge

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the DeepSearch Observability Challenge, a 3-hour exercise where participants implement OpenTelemetry (OTLP) instrumentation for a DeepSearch system. The challenge focuses on deriving meaningful insights rather than completing a rigid set of tasks.

## Documents

- **[observability_tasks.md](observability_tasks.md)**: The main challenge description with evaluation criteria and implementation guidance
- **[implementation_targets.md](implementation_targets.md)**: System components and valuable metrics to consider for instrumentation
- **[hackathon_guide.md](hackathon_guide.md)**: Event structure, evaluation approach, and practical advice

## Key Features of This Challenge

- **Creative Approach**: Focus on discovering meaningful insights rather than checking off tasks
- **Flexible Implementation**: Freedom to explore what's most valuable to observe
- **Insight-Driven Evaluation**: Solutions judged on the quality of the insights they reveal
- **Practical Demonstrability**: Emphasis on showing working solutions with clear value
- **Alert-based Monitoring**: Implementation of real-time alerts for system behavior

## Challenge Goal

The primary goal is to implement observability that provides meaningful insights into the DeepSearch system's behavior, performance, and effectiveness. Participants should focus on creating solutions that help understand and improve the system in ways that would be impossible without proper observability.

## Getting Started

Participants should:

1. Review all documentation in this directory
2. Understand the DeepSearch system components and operation
3. Build a foundation with OpenTelemetry instrumentation
4. Enrich spans with valuable context attributes
5. Implement at least one alerting scenario
6. Focus on revealing valuable insights about system behavior
7. Develop at least one interactive capability for exploring data

## Evaluation Approach

Solutions will be evaluated on:
- **Foundation Quality**: How well basic observability is implemented
- **Insight Value**: What the solution reveals about the system
- **Communication Effectiveness**: How well insights are presented
- **Technical Creativity**: Novel approaches to observability challenges

## Key Implementation Areas

- **Span Enrichment**: Adding context attributes to spans for deeper understanding
- **Metric Collection**: Gathering performance, quality, and resource metrics
- **Alerting Scenarios**: Implementing real-time monitoring for critical conditions
- **Interactive Exploration**: Building tools to dive deeper into system behavior
- **Visualization**: Creating clear presentations of system patterns and behaviors

## Implementation Timeline

- **First Hour**: Set up infrastructure and basic instrumentation
- **Second Hour**: Develop insights, alerting scenarios, and meaningful metrics
- **Final Hour**: Refine presentation and interactive capabilities
