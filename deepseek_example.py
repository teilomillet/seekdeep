    # General AI
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.",
    "AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.",
    
    # Machine Learning
    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.",
    "Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.",
    
    # Neural Networks
    "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.",
    "Neural networks learn to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules.",
    "A neural network is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.",
    
    # Deep Learning
    "Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.",
    "Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.",
    "Deep learning uses multiple layers of neural networks to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.",
    "The 'deep' in deep learning refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed."
