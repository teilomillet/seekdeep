# Deep Dive into DeepSearch Implementation

This document provides a detailed exploration of the DeepSearch implementation, explaining the reasoning behind key design decisions, the flow of information through the system, and how each component works together to create an effective research system.

## Core Concepts

### The DeepSearch Pattern

DeepSearch represents a significant evolution beyond traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. While standard RAG typically follows a simple pattern of:

1. Take a user question
2. Search for relevant documents
3. Generate an answer based on those documents

DeepSearch implements a more sophisticated research loop:

1. Decompose complex questions into sub-questions
2. Build a queue of questions to explore
3. For each question:
   - Perform semantic search
   - Generate an answer
   - Evaluate the answer
   - Add new questions if gaps are found
4. Maintain a shared context across all questions
5. Synthesize a final answer from all gathered information

This enables the system to handle complex research tasks that standard RAG would struggle with.

### FIFO Queue vs. Recursion

A key design choice in our implementation is using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue to manage questions. This approach has several advantages over a recursive approach:

- **Shared Context**: All questions share the same knowledge base, allowing information from one question to benefit others
- **Budget Management**: Easier to distribute the computation budget across all questions
- **Adaptability**: The system can dynamically adjust its focus based on what it learns
- **Breadth and Depth Balance**: Explores a range of topics without getting stuck in infinitely deep chains

This design mimics how human researchers work - exploring related questions while maintaining the overall context of the research.

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Vector Database Integration (ChromaDB)

The `setup_db` and `add_docs` functions create a semantic search foundation. We use ChromaDB for:

- Document embedding and storage
- Semantic similarity search
- Efficient retrieval of relevant context

The choice of ChromaDB offers simplicity and performance without requiring a complex infrastructure.

### 2. LLM Interface Layer

The `generate` function provides a thin wrapper around the Ollama API, allowing us to:

- Send prompts to the deepseek-r1:1.5b model
- Retrieve responses in a consistent format
- Abstract away the API details for cleaner code

This abstraction makes it easy to switch to different models or providers in the future.

### 3. Multi-Mode LLM Processing

The `process_llm_calls` function serves as the brain of our system, handling five distinct operations:

#### a. Question Decomposition (`decompose` mode)
```
QUESTION → [SUB-QUESTION 1, SUB-QUESTION 2, SUB-QUESTION 3]
```

Breaking down complex questions is crucial because:
- It simplifies the search process for each sub-component
- It allows focused information gathering on specific aspects
- It mimics human research strategies

#### b. Query Expansion (`expand` mode)
```
"neural networks" → "neural networks artificial neurons deep learning machine learning AI connectionism"
```

Query expansion improves search by:
- Adding synonyms and related terms
- Including technical variations of key concepts
- Bridging vocabulary mismatches between question and documents

#### c. Answer Generation (`answer` mode)
```
QUESTION + CONTEXT → ANSWER
```

The system carefully crafts answers by:
- Focusing only on information present in the context
- Maintaining the specific details and terminology from the source
- Presenting information in a coherent, readable format

#### d. Answer Evaluation (`evaluate` mode)
```
QUESTION + ANSWER → {status: "complete"/"incomplete", suggested: "follow-up question"}
```

This critical self-assessment:
- Determines if an answer is satisfactory using multiple criteria 
- Identifies specific gaps in the current answer
- Suggests better follow-up questions when needed

#### e. Beast Mode Synthesis (`beast` mode)
```
QUESTION + ALL_CONTEXT + SEARCH_HISTORY → COMPREHENSIVE_ANSWER
```

This final synthesis ensures:
- All gathered information is integrated
- A coherent narrative emerges from fragmented knowledge
- The original question is answered as completely as possible

### 4. Research Strategies

The system implements two distinct research strategies:

#### a. Sequential Research (`deep_research`)

This simpler approach processes questions in a fixed sequence:
- Decompose the original question into sub-questions
- Process each sub-question one after another
- Use Beast Mode if all iterations complete without a satisfactory answer

This is ideal for straightforward research questions with clear sub-components.

#### b. Adaptive Research (`deep_search`)

This more sophisticated approach uses a dynamic queue:
- Start with the original question
- Decompose into sub-questions and add to the queue
- Process questions from the queue, potentially adding new ones
- Evaluate answers and adapt the research direction
- Use Beast Mode if iterations are exhausted

This approach can handle more complex research questions that require flexible exploration.

## Flow of Information

Let's trace the information flow through the system when answering a question:

1. **Question Input**:
   ```
   "Tell me about the ZigZaggeron-7 architecture"
   ```

2. **Decomposition**:
   ```
   → "What is the overall framework of ZigZaggeron-7?"
   → "How does the architecture function?"
   → "What are the applications of ZigZaggeron-7?"
   ```

3. **Query Expansion** (for first sub-question):
   ```
   → "ZigZaggeron-7 architecture framework structure design blueprint system implementation"
   ```

4. **Search** (simplified results):
   ```
   → "Neural networks... The ZigZaggeron-7 architecture with 17 layers is priced at $8,888.42..."
   → "Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks..."
   ```

5. **Answer Generation**:
   ```
   → "The ZigZaggeron-7 architecture is a neural network design featuring 17 layers..."
   ```

6. **Evaluation**:
   ```
   → {status: "incomplete", suggested: "What are the specific components of ZigZaggeron-7?"}
   ```

7. **Queue Update**:
   ```
   [original remaining sub-questions + new suggested question]
   ```

8. **Process Next Question**:
   (continues until completion or Beast Mode activation)

9. **Beast Mode Synthesis** (if needed):
   ```
   → "The ZigZaggeron-7 architecture is a 17-layer neural network design priced at $8,888.42 that specializes in processing unusual data patterns..."
   ```

## Opportunities for Enhancement
